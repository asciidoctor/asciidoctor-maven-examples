= Asciidoctor Maven Plugin: Asciidoctor Diagram Example

An example project that demonstrates how to integrate Asciidoctor Diagram with the Asciidoctor Maven plugin.

== Usage

Convert the AsciiDoc to HTML5 by invoking the `process-resources` goal (configured as the default goal):

 $ mvn

Open the file _target/generated-docs/example-manual.html_ in your browser to see the generated HTML file containing the generated diagram images.

== Graphviz configuration
Asciidoctor Diagram bundles both the ditaa and PlantUML libraries and will use them to generate diagrams.
In order to generate diagrams using Graphviz, you must install it separately.
There are two options to reference the installed Graphviz's _dot_ tool in order to generate diagrams: system's PATH or plug-in attributes configuration.

=== Configuration via system's PATH
Visit link:https://www.graphviz.org/[Graphviz' site] for details on how to install the _dot_ command tool, and to make the _dot_ command available on your system's PATH.

=== Configuration via plug-in attributes
Once Graphviz binaries from the link:https://www.graphviz.org/[Graphviz' site] are available on the system, the plug-in attributes in the pom.xml can be used to reference to the _dot_ tool directly.
This type of configuration may be especially useful when working in a CI environment.
Example:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.asciidoctor</groupId>
    <artifactId>asciidoctor-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    ...
    <configuration>
        <attributes>
            <graphvizdot>/PATH/TO/Graphviz/bin/dot</graphvizdot>
        </attributes>
        ...
----
