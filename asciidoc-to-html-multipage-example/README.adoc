An example project that demonstrates how to convert AsciiDoc to multiple HTML pages with the Asciidoctor Maven plugin and https://github.com/owenh000/asciidoctor-multipage[Asciidoctor Multipage Extension^].

The AsciiDoc source of the demo presentation can be found in _src/docs/asciidoc/index.adoc_.
