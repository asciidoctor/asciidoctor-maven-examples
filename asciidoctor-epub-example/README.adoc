:kindlegen-download-url: https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1000765211

An example project that demonstrates how to convert AsciiDoc to EPUB using Asciidoctor EPUB3 with the Asciidoctor Maven plugin.

== Usage

=== EPUB

This example requires providing the path to `kindlegen` in the `KINDLEGEN` environment variable (you have to download it for your OS from amazon here: {kindlegen-download-url}).

Once done, convert the AsciiDoc to EPUB using https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-epub3/[Asciidoctor EPUB3] by invoking the `process-resources` goal (configured as the default goal):

 $ mvn

Open the file _target/generated-docs/spine.epub_ in your epub viewer to see the generated epub.

=== MOBI

There is a second process available to generate a kindle document, you can enable a second execution block in the pom.xml.
If _kindlegen_ is in your path a mobi file should be generated.
