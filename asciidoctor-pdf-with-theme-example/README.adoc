= Asciidoctor Maven Plugin: AsciiDoc to PDF Book Example

An example project that demonstrates how to convert AsciiDoc to PDF using Asciidoctor PDF with the Asciidoctor Maven plugin.
This example produces a book and make use of a YAML style sheet (defined in `src/theme`).
The same document is rendered twice:

* Without the theme configuration, output is `target/generated-docs-default-theme/example-manual.pdf`
* With the theme configuration, output is `target/generated-docs-custom-theme/example-manual.pdf`

== Usage

Convert the AsciiDoc to PDF using Asciidoctor PDF by invoking the `process-resources` goal (configured as the default goal):

 $ mvn

Open the file _target/generated-docs-custom-theme/example-manual.pdf_ in your PDF viewer to see the generated PDF.
